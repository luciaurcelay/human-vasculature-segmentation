## Description

:warning: Code is currently being refactored :warning:

The goal of this competition is to segment instances of microvascular structures, including capillaries, arterioles, and venules.

This work implements and trains a UNet architecture to solve the task.

## Getting Started

### Installing

#### Optional: Create a Virtual Environment
If you want to use a virtual environment to run the program, you can create one using venv module in Python. Follow the appropriate steps for your operating system:
* Linux/Mac
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
* Windows
```
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

#### Installing Python Dependencies
After activating the virtual environment, install the required Python dependencies using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

### Executing program
* To run the program, execute the main.py script:
```
python main.py
```
* This will run the program and execute the main functionality.
